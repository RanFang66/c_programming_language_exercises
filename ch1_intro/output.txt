  Description: This function is called to delay execution of the currently running task until the 
               specified number of system ticks expires.  This, of course, directly equates to delaying
               the current task for some time to expire.  No delay will result If the specified delay is 
               0.  If the specified delay is greater than 0 then, a context switch will result.
 
  Arguments  : ticks    is the time delay that the task will be suspended in number of clock 'ticks'.  
                         Note that by specifying 0, the task will not be delayed.
